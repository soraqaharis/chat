# ChatApp - Real-time Messaging with React, Node.js, and Socket.io

### Overview
*ChatApp* is a real-time messaging application built with *React* on the frontend, *Node.js* for the backend, and *Socket.io* for seamless, instant messaging. This project does not use a database, focusing on real-time communication only.

### Features
- 🔄 *Real-time Messaging*: Enables instant, direct messages between users.
- 📲 *React Frontend*: Clean, responsive UI for an interactive chat experience.
- 🚀 *Node.js Backend*: Efficient server setup for handling multiple connections.
- 🌐 *Socket.io*: Provides live, two-way communication between clients and server.

### How It Works
ChatApp establishes a *Socket.io* connection between clients and the server, allowing messages to be exchanged in real-time without any data being stored. Perfect for temporary conversations or demo environments where message history isn’t necessary.
